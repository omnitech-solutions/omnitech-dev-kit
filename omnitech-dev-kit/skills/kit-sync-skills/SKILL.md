description: "Use when the user says \"sync skills\", \"push the kit skills to omp\", or after editing any skill under the kit. Mirrors kit skills (kit-* and borrowed/*) into machine-local live skill directories such as ~/.omp/agent/skills, kit to target only, and prints a receipt of added/updated/unchanged. Never deletes non-kit skills; never commits or pushes."

# kit-sync-skills

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: runtime-compat -->
## Runtime compatibility

This skill is portable across Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode. This section overrides platform-specific labels below.

- Before running a command that uses `CRUX_PLUGIN_ROOT`, set it to the installed plugin root. In Claude Code, use the value of `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`. In Codex and OpenCode, derive it from the absolute path of this selected `SKILL.md`: the plugin root is the parent of its `skills/` directory. In a source checkout, use the checkout `crux/` directory.
- For project-local skills, use `.claude/skills` in Claude Code, `.agents/skills` in Codex, and `.opencode/skills` in OpenCode, which also reads the singular `.opencode/skill`. Set `CRUX_LOCAL_SKILLS_DIR` to that path before following any command below that uses it.
- Translate Claude Code tool labels such as `Agent`, `Read`, `Write`, `Bash`, `WebSearch`, and `WebFetch` to the matching capability in the current session. Codex names its own capabilities; OpenCode uses the lowercase forms `subagent`, `read`, `edit`, `shell`, `websearch`, and `webfetch`, where `edit` covers both `Edit` and `Write`. Do not attempt to invoke the Claude Code labels as literal commands on another host.
- Install the generated role agents before delegating: `install-codex-agents` in Codex, `install-opencode-agents` in OpenCode. Codex names them `crux_architect`, `crux_brainstormer`, `crux_commander`, `crux_dev_lead`, `crux_developer`, `crux_historian`, `crux_librarian`, `crux_night_gardener`, `crux_reviewer`, and `crux_wayfinder`; OpenCode uses the bare role names `architect`, `brainstormer`, `commander`, `dev-lead`, `developer`, `historian`, `librarian`, `night-gardener`, `reviewer`, and `wayfinder`. If a required role or capability is unavailable, report that truthfully instead of claiming it ran.
- Argument placeholders such as `$adr` and `$book` bind only in Claude Code. On a host without argument binding they are unset — take the value from the user's phrase. The "Fields OpenCode ignores" section of `OPENCODE_GUIDE.md` names the invocation-control fields OpenCode ignores.

## Procedure
1. `python3 ${KIT_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/sync_skills.py --dry-run` and read the receipt.
2. If the plan is right: `python3 ${KIT_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/sync_skills.py [--target DIR ...]`.
3. Read the receipt back to the user verbatim. Claude Code and Codex pick up changes through the plugin marketplace update, not this script.

## Never
Sync target to kit (the kit is the source of truth). Edit a synced copy in place.
